	<br /> &emsp;&emsp; Radiolarians are protists found on sediments. These species are mainly used to date rocks 
	from which it was found. Each is distinguished by their structure and presence or absence of certain features
	 such as spines and ridges. Radiolarian assemblages have played a significant role as a biostratigraphic and 
	 paleoenvironmental tool used in the geological settings. These species can be used in studying sediments 
	 lacking calcareous fossils. Moreover, there are instances in which only Radiolarians are the only invaluable 
	 species present in order to determine the age of particular strata.
	<br />
	<br /> &emsp;&emsp; Classifying microfossils of these species is tedious. Requiring a high level of expertise, 
	vast number of references and such eyes for details. Up until now, researchers still go through a lot of work 
	in naming and studying these species. 
	<br />
	<br /> &emsp;&emsp; RadiSS is a decision support system designed to help researchers in classifying Radiolarian 
	species given an image. It aims to minimize the effort in coming up with the possible name of the target species. 
	As a consequence, further studies on the structure and way of living of these species can be given more attention. 
	Even the dating process of the sediment on which the species was found could be done easily.
