	<br /> &emsp;&emsp; Radiolarians are protists found on sediments. These species are mainly used to date rocks from which it was found. 
	Each is distinguished by their structure and prsence or absence of certain features such as spines and ridges.
	<br />
	<br /> &emsp;&emsp; Classifying microfossils of these species is tedious. Requiring a high level of expertise, 
	vast number of references and such eyes for details. Up until now, researchers still go through a lot of work 
	in naming and studying these species. 
	<br />
	<br /> &emsp;&emsp; RadiSS is a decision support system designed to help researchers in classifying Radiolarian 
	species given an image.
