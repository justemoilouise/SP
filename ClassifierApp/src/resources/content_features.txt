<br />
Shape and texture descriptors are extracted from the image which are used to classify the species' class.
<br />
<h2>Shape descriptors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Circularity - a value of 1.0 means it’s a perfect circle while a value approaching 0.0 indicates that the shape of the object is increasingly elongated</li>
  <li>Aspect ratio - aspect ratio based on the object’s fitted ellipse</li>
  <li>Round - inverse of the aspect ratio</li>
  <li>Solidity - described by the area over convex area</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>Texture descriptors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Angular second moment - measure of the image’s homogeneity or the similarity of each pixel in the image</li>
  <li>Contrast - represents if a pixel is similar to its neighboring pixel</li>
  <li>Correlation - measure of the linear dependency of two neighboring pixels over the whole image</li>
  <li>Entropy - indicates the amount of information necessary for image compression</li>
  <li>Inverse difference moment - measures the closeness of the distribution of elements in the GLCM to those in the diagonal of the matrix</li>
  <li>Sum average</li>
  <li>Sum variance</li>
  <li>Sum entropy</li>
  <li>Sum of squares: variance</li>
  <li>Difference variance</li>
  <li>Difference entropy</li>
  <li>Info. Measure of correlation 1</li>
  <li>Info. Measure of correlation 2</li>
  <li>Maximum correlation coefficient</li>
</ul>
