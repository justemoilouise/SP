  Shape and texture descriptors are extracted from the image which are used to classify the species' class.

** Shape descriptors
  a. Circularity - a value of 1.0 means it’s a perfect circle while a value approaching 0.0 indicates that the shape of the object is increasingly elongated
  b. Aspect ratio - aspect ratio based on the object’s fitted ellipse 
  c. Round - inverse of the aspect ratio
  d. Solidity - described by the area over convex area

** Texture descriptors
  a. Angular second moment - measure of the image’s homogeneity or the similarity of each pixel in the image
  b. Contrast - represents if a pixel is similar to its neighboring pixel
  c. Correlation - measure of the linear dependency of two neighboring pixels over the whole image
  d. Entropy - indicates the amount of information necessary for image compression
  e. Inverse difference moment - measures the closeness of the distribution of elements in the GLCM to those in the diagonal of the matrix
  f. Sum average
  g. Sum variance
  h. Sum entropy
  i. Sum of squares: variance
  j. Difference variance
  k. Difference entropy
  l. Info. Measure of correlation 1
  m. Info. Measure of correlation 2
  n. Maximum correlation coefficient
