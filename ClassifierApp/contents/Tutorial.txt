  RadiSS is a tool that can be used to classify and cluster Radiolarian species. It has for major processes - image feature extraction, preprocessing, classification and clustering.

**Image feature extraction
  Classification and clustering of Radiolarian species depends on the characteristics fed into the application. These data are features extracted from an image of a particular Radiolarian species.
  Feature extraction is a way of getting visual contents from a digital image.
  In this application, ImageJ is the primary tools used for this process. Two different sets of features can be obtained from an image - ImageJ's shape descriptors and texture features, and JFeatureLib's Haralick texture descriptora. These values, once retrieved from the image, will then be used to classify and cluster the input.

**Preprocessing
  It employs two preprocessing techniques - scaling and PCA. During scaling, the value of each feature is calculated to only have a range of 0 to 1. As soon as the features are scaled, it immediately undergoes feature reduction through Principal Components Analysis.
  Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method mainly used for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. It works by rotating the original set of variables in such a way that the result, known as the principal components, maximizes the variance such that no information is lost after the transformation. This process is important to reduce computational cost.

**Classification
  For classification, the application uses Support Vector Machines (SVM). It is a particular kind of machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theories. The algorithm works by drawing a hyperplane that separates the data points into various classes.

**Clustering
  Self-Organizing Map was used to determine the natural clustering of the species. It's an unsupervised data visualization technique aiming to find an underlying structure of the given data.
