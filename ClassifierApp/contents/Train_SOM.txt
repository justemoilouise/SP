**Map width and height
  This pertains to the dimensions of the SOM lattice.

**Iterations
  The number of iterations the clustering algorithm will run to.
  
**Distance metric
  Specifies which distance metric function will be used to calculate the similarity/dissimilarity of each species.
  Distance metric could be Euclidean, Manhattan or Minkowski.

**Learning rate
  This pertains to the rate at which SOM adjust the waits of each species.

**Radius
  Determines the number of neighbors of each unit to consider during the clustering process.
