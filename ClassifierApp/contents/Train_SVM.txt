**SVM Type
  Determines which SVM type to use.
  There are 5 types of SVM to choose from - C-SVC, nu-SVC, one-class SVM, epsilon-SVR and nu-SVR. First three are mainly used for classification while the last two for regression.
  
**SVM Kernel
  Specifies which type of SVM kernel is used to train the SVM model.
  There are 4 types of kernel that can be used - Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF) or Sigmoid
  
**Coef, Nu, Degree, Gamma, Cost, Epsilon
  These are parameters needed in the different kernel functions.
