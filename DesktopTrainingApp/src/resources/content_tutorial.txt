RaDSS is a decision support system designed to help researchers in classifying Radiolarian species given an image. It aims to minimize the effort in coming up with the possible name of the target species. As a consequence, further studies on the structure and way of living of these species can be given more attention. Even the dating process of the sediment on which the species was found could be done easily.

<h3>Image feature extraction</h3>
  Classification and clustering of Radiolarian species depends on the characteristics fed into the application. These data are features extracted from an image of a particular Radiolarian species.
  Feature extraction is a way of getting visual contents from a digital image.
  In this application, ImageJ is the primary tools used for this process. Two different sets of features can be obtained from an image - ImageJ's shape descriptors and texture features, and JFeatureLib's Haralick texture descriptors. These values, once retrieved from the image, will then be used to classify and cluster the input.

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
  It employs two preprocessing techniques - scaling and PCA. During scaling, the value of each feature is calculated to only have a range of 0 to 1. As soon as the features are scaled, it immediately undergoes feature reduction through Principal Components Analysis.
  Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method mainly used for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. It works by rotating the original set of variables in such a way that the result, known as the principal components, maximizes the variance such that no information is lost after the transformation. This process is important to reduce computational cost.

<h3>Classification</h3>
  For classification, the application uses Support Vector Machines (SVM). It is a particular kind of machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theories. The algorithm works by drawing a hyperplane that separates the data points into various classes.
